        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Myles Lewando
        <span class="aside">(pronounced 'le-van-doe')</span>, a web developer and data artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        By day, I work as a front-end web developer at
        <a href="https://www.adgistics.com/">Adgistics</a>. By night, I work
        on web, map and datavis projects ranging from personal, to humanitarian and non-profit, to commercial.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an (ethical) open-source and open-data advocate and I value web accessibility, inclusive design and self-directed digital learning. I also have an affinity for space, ecology, insects, and the macabre
        <span class="aside">(hence the alias 'CodeMacabre')</span>.
      </p>
      <p>I'd love to help you with your map or web project, particularly if it's open source or aligned with my interests and values. Get in touch!</p>

        About CodeMacabre
      </h2>
      <p>
        Being fascinated by medical history, mortality and art, I naturally veer towards darker themes. One of my favourite series of artworks are Hans Holbein's
        <a href="https://archive.org/details/lessimulachreshi1538holb/">Danse Macabre</a> woodcuts. The meaning behind these prints aligns surprisingly closely with ideas of inclusivity and equality and, as a developer, it felt
        like an obvious progression to consider a Code Macabre, a modern-day progression of the
        <em>danse</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That inclusivity and equality is a fundamental right of everyone, regardless of our gender, sexuality, race, mental or physical ableness, wealth, etc. I beleive the code that powers the web should respect those rights; the
        <em>danse macabre</em>'s idea of 'equality in mortality' and respecting others accordingly rings true today across our physical and digital lives.
      </p>
      <p>CodeMacabre therefore is my mission; I intend to work towards these tenets with everything I do, starting with the web.</p>
