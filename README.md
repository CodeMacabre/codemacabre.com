This repo contains the CodeMacabre website, [codemacabre.com](https://codemacabre.com).

## Development

A 2020 redesign and restructure is in progress which will likely use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) (subject to change). One of the main changes will be the addition of a [blog](https://codemacabre.com/blog).

## Design

Alongside [Ethical Design](https://ind.ie/ethical-design), this site will abide by the following principals:

1. Be inclusive and accessible
2. Be lightweight and minimal
3. Be modern and daring

This means that while the site will have a somewhat experimental, changeable nature, it will always have inclusivity at its heart. If any of these experiments fail, cause anything to break or cease being accessible, [please do let me know](https://codemacabre.com#contact).
